# Predicting-Antibiotic-Resistance-Phenotypes-Using-Whole-Genome-k-mer-Signatures
Predicting antibiotic resistance using whole-genome k-mer features and machine learning. Public BV-BRC genomes were processed into hashed k-mer vectors, and models (LogReg, RF, SVM, GBM) were trained and evaluated using ROC-AUC, F1, and cross-validation to assess predictive power.
