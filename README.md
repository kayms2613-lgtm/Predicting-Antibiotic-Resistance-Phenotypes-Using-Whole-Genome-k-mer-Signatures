## 🔍 Introduction

Antibiotic resistance (AR) is an urgent and escalating global health threat, driven by genomic mutations and mobile genetic elements that enable bacteria to survive antibiotic treatment. Traditional phenotypic susceptibility testing is accurate but slow, often requiring 24–48 hours and delaying clinical decisions. This motivates the development of rapid, genome-based computational approaches capable of predicting resistance directly from sequence data.

This project investigates whether **whole-genome k-mer signatures**—short, fixed-length substrings extracted from raw DNA—can accurately distinguish *Escherichia coli* isolates that are resistant or susceptible to ciprofloxacin. Unlike database-matching tools such as CARD or ResFinder, k-mer–based methods do not rely on prior knowledge of AMR genes or SNP catalogs, making them well-suited for detecting emerging or previously uncharacterized resistance mechanisms.

Building on alignment-free genomics research, this study tests the hypothesis that genomic sequence patterns carry sufficient discriminative signal for resistance prediction. Using curated genomes paired with high-quality phenotype labels, multiple machine-learning models were trained and evaluated to identify the strength of k-mer–based prediction and determine which approaches perform best on this dataset.

## 📘 Project Summary

A curated set of **26 E. coli genomes** with ciprofloxacin resistance phenotypes was downloaded from BV-BRC. After preprocessing and filtering, each genome was converted into a normalized vector of **31-mer counts**, and a dense **26 × 10,000** k-mer matrix was generated.

Four models—**Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and Gradient Boosting**—were trained to determine how effectively k-mer patterns predict resistance. Early results show promising predictive performance, especially for tree-based models, with several high-importance k-mers mapping to regions associated with known fluoroquinolone resistance pathways (including *gyrA* and *parC*).

The notebook produces key visualizations including ROC curves, confusion matrices, feature-importance plots, and class-distribution summaries to support interpretation. Although the dataset is small, the balanced class distribution and consistent preprocessing steps strengthen the reliability of the findings.

## 💬 Discussion

Initial results strongly support the project’s hypothesis: **k-mer–based representations of whole genomes can distinguish resistant from susceptible E. coli isolates.** The presence of high-importance k-mers corresponding to known resistance genes (e.g., *gyrA*, *parC*) reinforces the biological validity of machine-learning predictions.

Despite the small dataset (n=26), both SVM and Random Forest showed clear predictive trends, suggesting that genomic patterns driving resistance are detectable even with limited samples. However, Logistic Regression underperformed, indicating that AR mechanisms are nonlinear and distributed across multiple genomic regions.

Some limitations remain:

- Small genome count restricts generalizability.  
- High dimensionality (10,000 k-mers) may introduce noise.  
- Gradient Boosting instability indicates need for more samples.

Upcoming steps will include hyperparameter tuning, mapping informative k-mers to genomic coordinates, and enhancing feature reduction to strengthen interpretability.

**Overall, these results demonstrate promising potential for scalable, alignment-free antibiotic resistance prediction using k-mer-based machine learning.**
