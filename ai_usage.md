## AI Usage & Reproducibility Statement

This project used AI tools (ChatGPT) only for documentation support, explanation refinement, and formatting assistance, not for scientific analysis or model generation.

---

## 🔹 How AI Was Used

Drafting and refining written content (introduction, methods, results, README).

Improving clarity and structure of explanations and markdown formatting.

Formatting tables and summarizing non-biological concepts.

Providing coding guidance for general structure, but not performing biological computation.

## 🔹 How AI Was Not Used

❌ No AI system analyzed genomes, extracted k-mers, trained models, or generated predictions.

❌ No biological interpretations, metrics, or feature importance values were AI-generated.

❌ AI was not used to produce or manipulate scientific data in any form.

All scientific results come entirely from the Python code and manual analysis performed by project members.

## 🔹 Verification of AI-Assisted Content

All AI-assisted text was:

Manually reviewed for scientific and technical accuracy.

Checked against actual model outputs and datasets.

Revised or corrected whenever needed to maintain integrity.

No AI-generated content was accepted without human verification.

## 🔹 Reproducibility Practices

All notebooks and Python scripts are included in the repository.

Software versions (Python 3.10, Biopython 1.83, NumPy 1.26, pandas 2.2, scikit-learn 1.4, matplotlib 3.8) are listed in requirements.txt.

Random seeds were set for reproducible model training.

Public BV-BRC datasets used in the project are stored inside the dataset/ directory.

All generated outputs (ROC curves, confusion matrices, feature plots) are saved under outputs/.

🔹 Ethical Considerations

Only public, non-human bacterial genomic data were used.

AI usage stayed within documentation support; no unverified AI-generated scientific claims were included.

All final interpretations reflect human judgment and validation.
